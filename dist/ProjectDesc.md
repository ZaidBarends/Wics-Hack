# Digital Problem-Solving Academy for Women  
**Empowering Rural and Disadvantaged Women Through Computing Skills – Without Code**

---

## Hackathon Pitch Summary

Millions of women in rural and disadvantaged communities are excluded from the digital economy because most learning platforms start with coding, a barrier for learners who only have basic computer skills and limited access to education.  

**Yanga** is a **micro-learning web app** that teaches computing fundamentals **without programming**, using **real-life examples and interactive lessons**. Women learn **digital problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and data literacy** through practical scenarios they can relate to, such as managing a spaza shop, budgeting for a household, or organizing farming tasks.

---

## Problem Statement

- Over **500 million women globally lack access to meaningful digital education**.
- Most digital skills platforms **assume prior education or coding interest**.
- Rural women face **additional barriers**:
  - Limited access to structured learning
  - Low data budgets and poor connectivity
  - Lack of confidence in technology
  - Courses are often not in their context or language

**To close the gender digital divide, we must teach computing in a way that is relevant, accessible, and empowering, starting with thinking skills, not code.**
